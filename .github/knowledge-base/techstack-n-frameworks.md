# Tech Stack and Frameworks

**Programming Language**: Python is ideal due to its rich ecosystem for data science and finance. We will use **Python 3** (ensuring compatibility with latest libraries).

**Core Libraries**: Leverage popular libraries for data handling, analysis, and performance, including:

- **Pandas and NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and numerical computations. Pandas DataFrames make it easy to handle time-series OHLCV data and align timestamps, while NumPy provides fast array operations under the hood ([Backtesting.py - Backtest trading strategies in Python](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/#:~:text=Blazing%20fast%2C%20convenient)). Many backtesting frameworks (e.g. Backtesting.py) are built on Pandas/Numpy for speed and convenience ([Backtesting.py - Backtest trading strategies in Python](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/#:~:text=Blazing%20fast%2C%20convenient)). Using these libraries ensures vectorized computations where possible, which is a best practice for performance in Python.
- **Python Binance API or CCXT**: To fetch historical price data. The [python-binance](https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance) library provides convenient methods for accessing Binance data (e.g. `Client.get_historical_klines` for candlesticks). Alternatively, **CCXT** is a unified API that supports 100+ exchanges including Binance ([CCXT Python: Exploring Cryptocurrency Trading on Binance, Kucoin, and Bitmex | by Manaan Ansari | AWS Tip](https://awstip.com/ccxt-python-exploring-cryptocurrency-trading-on-binance-kucoin-and-bitmex-b2bae06ce79c#:~:text=CCXT%20is%20a%20popular%20open,to%20build%20cryptocurrency%20trading%20applications)). CCXT can simplify integration with multiple exchanges by abstracting away exchange-specific details in a single library ([CCXT Python: Exploring Cryptocurrency Trading on Binance, Kucoin, and Bitmex | by Manaan Ansari | AWS Tip](https://awstip.com/ccxt-python-exploring-cryptocurrency-trading-on-binance-kucoin-and-bitmex-b2bae06ce79c#:~:text=CCXT%20is%20a%20popular%20open,to%20build%20cryptocurrency%20trading%20applications)). Starting with Binance data via python-binance (or CCXT's Binance support) will cover initial needs, and CCXT can be used later to extend to other exchanges with minimal changes.
- **Technical Analysis Libraries**: For indicator-based strategies, use libraries like **TA-Lib** or **Pandas TA** to compute common technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.) ([Backtesting.py - Backtest trading strategies in Python](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/#:~:text=Technical%20indicator%20library%20agnostic)). These libraries offer a large collection of indicators out-of-the-box, saving users from writing indicator calculations from scratch. The system should be indicator-library-agnostic, meaning users can plug in any library or custom indicator calculations as needed ([Backtesting.py - Backtest trading strategies in Python](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/#:~:text=Technical%20indicator%20library%20agnostic)). This flexibility is important for quant engineers who may have custom signals.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: To support ML strategies, utilize Python’s ML ecosystem. **Scikit-learn** is recommended for classic algorithms (regression, classification, clustering) due to its simplicity and versatility. For more complex deep learning models, frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** could be optionally supported, but initially, scikit-learn (or even statsmodels for statistical models) should suffice. Ensure the strategy interface allows integrating an ML model (e.g. loading a pre-trained model or training one on historical data) seamlessly.
- **Performance Metrics & Analysis**: Leverage existing libraries to compute performance metrics and visualize results. For example, **Empyrical** (by Quantopian) or **Pyfolio/QuantStats** can calculate Sharpe, drawdowns, and other stats given a returns series ([Backtesting Systematic Trading Strategies in Python: Considerations and Open Source Frameworks | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks/#:~:text=Performance%20testing%20applies%20the%20STS,statistics)). These libraries can save time and ensure standardized calculations. Alternatively, implementing a small metrics module using NumPy/Pandas is feasible (e.g. functions for Sharpe ratio, drawdown, etc., as shown in QuantStart’s `performance.py` ([Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part VII | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-VII/#:~:text=%5Cbegin%7Beqnarray,R_b%29%7D%7D%20%5Cend%7Beqnarray)) ([Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part VII | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-VII/#:~:text=The%20maximum%20drawdown%20and%20drawdown,periods%20over%20which%20it%20occurs))). Visualization isn’t a primary focus for CLI tools, but you might integrate Matplotlib or Plotly for optional equity curve charts or output that users can plot.
- **CLI / API Framework**: Provide both a **command-line interface (CLI)** and a Python API. For CLI, Python’s built-in **argparse** or the **Click** library are good choices to parse user inputs (e.g. strategy file, symbol, date range). The CLI tool (`backtest.py` for instance) can allow users to run `python backtest.py --strategy my_strategy.py --symbol BTCUSDT --start 2020-01-01 --end 2021-01-01`. The Python API will allow advanced users (quant engineers) to import the backtesting engine as a module and run programmatic experiments, integrate with Jupyter notebooks, etc. Keeping the API simple and well-documented is crucial (aim for a clean API that “fits on a page” similar to Backtesting.py’s design ([Backtesting.py - Backtest trading strategies in Python](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/#:~:text=))).

**Open-Source Framework References**: It’s wise to study existing open-source backtesting frameworks for inspiration and best practices. Frameworks like **Backtrader**, **Backtesting.py**, **Zipline**, and **VectorBT** all have useful design ideas:

- *Backtrader*: An event-driven, feature-rich backtesting framework that allows writing reusable strategies and includes many built-in indicators ([Backtesting Systematic Trading Strategies in Python: Considerations and Open Source Frameworks | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks/#:~:text=This%20platform%20is%20exceptionally%20well,Interactive%20Brokers%20and%20Visual%20Chart)). It’s known for its easy strategy API and extensive documentation. Backtrader can also connect to live brokers like Interactive Brokers, which informs how to design for future live trading. (Project: backtrader.com ([Backtesting Systematic Trading Strategies in Python: Considerations and Open Source Frameworks | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks/#:~:text=This%20platform%20is%20exceptionally%20well,Interactive%20Brokers%20and%20Visual%20Chart)))
- *Backtesting.py*: A lightweight, user-friendly framework that emphasizes speed (built on Pandas/NumPy) and interactivity. Notably, it supports both vectorized and event-driven modes ([Backtesting.py - Backtest trading strategies in Python](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/#:~:text=Vectorized%20or%20event)). It’s indicator-agnostic and even has built-in optimizers for parameter tuning ([Backtesting.py - Backtest trading strategies in Python](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/#:~:text=Built)). Studying its small API and strategy definition approach can guide our own API design.
- *VectorBT*: A high-performance vectorized backtesting library, known to be one of the fastest in Python by leveraging NumPy for bulk computations ([Best Backtesting Library for Python – Martin Mayer-Krebs](https://mayerkrebs.com/best-backtesting-library-for-python/#:~:text=The%20fastest%20python%20library%20for,commonly%20unavailable%20on%20these%20backtesters)). It shows that even complex features like trailing stops can be handled in a vectorized manner ([Best Backtesting Library for Python – Martin Mayer-Krebs](https://mayerkrebs.com/best-backtesting-library-for-python/#:~:text=The%20fastest%20python%20library%20for,commonly%20unavailable%20on%20these%20backtesters)). While we may not implement full vectorization initially, VectorBT’s techniques (and limitations such as less straightforward syntax ([Best Backtesting Library for Python – Martin Mayer-Krebs](https://mayerkrebs.com/best-backtesting-library-for-python/#:~:text=The%20main%20drawback%20of%20VectorBT,a%20broad%20range%20of%20topics))) highlight the trade-offs between speed and flexibility.
- *QuantStart QSTrader*: An open-source framework focused on modular, institutional-grade design ([Backtesting Systematic Trading Strategies in Python: Considerations and Open Source Frameworks | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks/#:~:text=QSTrader%20is%20a%20backtesting%20framework,tick%20data%20to%20be%20used)). QSTrader is fully event-driven and separates concerns (data handling, execution, risk management) with modular components. It also illustrates how backtesting and live trading code can be unified for easy transition to real trading ([Backtesting Systematic Trading Strategies in Python: Considerations and Open Source Frameworks | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks/#:~:text=Both%20backtesting%20and%20live%20trading,often%20identical%20across%20both%20deployments)). We will adopt a similar modular philosophy for extensibility.

**Best Practices & Challenges**: When assembling the tech stack, ensure compatibility between components (e.g., data frames used by strategies, indicator library output, etc.). A potential challenge is managing library dependencies (for example, TA-Lib requires a C library installation). To mitigate this, consider using pure-python indicator libraries (like pandas-ta) if users might have trouble installing C dependencies. Additionally, document the environment setup clearly for users. Another best practice is writing unit tests for each module (data fetching, metric calculations, trade simulation) – Python’s pytest can be used – to ensure the engine’s correctness as it evolves.
