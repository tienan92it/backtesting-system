This guide outlines a plan to build a Python-based backtesting system for crypto trading strategies, targeted at individual traders and quant engineers. The system will fetch historical data (initially from Binance) and simulate trades on past data to evaluate strategy performance. It will support both technical indicator strategies and machine learning (ML) based strategies. At first, the focus is on backtesting (no live trading yet), but the design will be extensible to add other exchanges and live trading in the future. Key performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate, risk metrics, profit factor, etc.) will be computed to assess each strategy. The user interface will be command-line or API-driven, allowing users to script their own strategies and quickly obtain results. The following sections detail the recommended technology stack, data handling approach, strategy integration, backtesting engine architecture, extensibility considerations, performance optimizations, and example strategies.
