# Extensibility (Additional Exchanges and Future Live Trading)

The system should be built with future growth in mind. Two key areas of extensibility are: **supporting more exchanges/data sources** and **transitioning to live trading execution**.

**Multiple Exchange Support**: To extend beyond Binance, design the data fetching and execution layers abstractly:

- Use an **exchange parameter** in configuration or CLI. E.g., `-exchange Binance` (default) or `-exchange Coinbase`. This will tell the system which API to use. All exchanges provide similar data (OHLCV), but the implementation might differ (endpoints, authentication for some).
- Abstract the differences by defining a **DataFetcher interface** with methods like `get_historical_data(symbol, interval, start, end) -> DataFrame`. Implement this for Binance initially. For a new exchange, create a new class implementing the same interface (could reuse a lot of code if using CCXT, since CCXT can fetch from any exchange by just changing the exchange id). For example, a CoinbaseFetcher might call CCXT’s Coinbase methods or Coinbase’s REST API directly.
- Similarly, abstract the **execution**. In backtesting mode, execution is simulation. But we can still plan for a **Broker interface** with methods like `execute_order(order)` or `get_balance()`. In backtest, our Broker simply simulates and updates Portfolio. For live trading, a Broker implementation would connect to exchange APIs (e.g., Binance’s REST or WebSocket for orders). By coding against an interface, the strategy doesn’t care whether it’s backtest or live – it just calls `buy()` and behind the scenes the appropriate broker executes it (real or simulated) ([Backtesting Systematic Trading Strategies in Python: Considerations and Open Source Frameworks | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks/#:~:text=Both%20backtesting%20and%20live%20trading,often%20identical%20across%20both%20deployments)). This is how QSTrader and other event-driven frameworks allow the same strategy code to be reused in live trading with minimal changes ([Backtesting Systematic Trading Strategies in Python: Considerations and Open Source Frameworks | QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks/#:~:text=Both%20backtesting%20and%20live%20trading,often%20identical%20across%20both%20deployments)).
- **CCXT Integration**: As mentioned, CCXT can be a backbone for multi-exchange support. We could wrap CCXT calls in our DataFetcher/Broker. For example, CCXT’s unified methods `fetch_ohlcv` for data and `create_order` for live trades can cover many exchanges. This saves having to write separate code for each exchange’s API. It also means if an exchange changes its API, updating CCXT will fix our system too. One caution: CCXT introduces an external dependency and sometimes inconsistencies between exchanges (not all data fields are standardized), so careful testing per exchange is needed.

**Extending Asset Classes**: While focusing on crypto, the architecture could potentially support other asset classes (stocks, forex) if the data is in similar format. This would involve adding DataFetchers for sources like Yahoo Finance or Interactive Brokers, and ensuring the Portfolio can handle different quote currencies or trading hours. This isn’t a priority now, but keeping the design generic (e.g., refer to “asset” instead of specifically “crypto”) where possible can avoid hard-coding to crypto only.

**Live Trading Integration (Future Plan)**: Though the initial release is backtest-only, we plan for live trading capability. To make this transition easier:

- Keep the event-driven structure. In live trading, you would still get market data events (from WebSocket or polling), pass them to the strategy, and execute orders via broker API – the loop just happens in real-time instead of fast-forwarding through a dataset. By maintaining a similar interface, the strategy code remains the same.
- Ensure time handling in backtest versus live is compatible. In backtest, we might treat each candle’s timestamp as “now” in simulation. In live, we will use actual current time. We can design the system’s time management such that strategies maybe always use relative indexing or the data object rather than calling real `datetime.now()`, so they don’t know the difference. Or provide a clock abstraction.
- Logging and monitoring for live will be important (e.g., outputting to console or files in real-time), but the backtest system can incorporate a similar logging which we can reuse.
- **Risk Management**: Live trading will need more robust risk checks (like not exceeding certain position sizes or handling disconnects). If we plan these modules early (even if not fully used in backtest), we can slot them in later.
- **Execution speed**: In live trading, decisions might need to be made quickly on streaming data. Our backtester, if efficient, should be fine (most strategies operate on candle-level data, not high-frequency ticks). If someone tries to do very high-frequency in live (sub-second), then Python might be too slow without optimization, but that might be beyond our scope.

**Plug-in Architecture**: Design the system such that adding a new component doesn’t require modifying the core logic heavily. For example, allow users to “register” a new exchange handler or new indicator module. This could be done via config files or a plugin system. While not needed immediately, an advanced user might want to plug in a custom slippage model or a custom data source. Having clear interfaces and using dependency injection (passing in the component objects) will facilitate this.

**Documentation for Extensibility**: Provide guides on how to add a new exchange. E.g., “to add a new exchange, implement `BaseFetcher` with methods X, Y, and add it to the exchange mapping in the config.” Also, ensure the code is well-documented and perhaps structured in a package format, so external contributors or advanced users can extend it.

**Challenges**: Every exchange has nuances (rate limits, different symbols naming conventions, time zone differences, etc.). Using CCXT mitigates some, but not all. Testing on real APIs (maybe in a sandbox or with small live tests) will be necessary to ensure our abstraction works. Another challenge is security for live trading (API keys management) – we’ll need to handle that carefully (likely by reading keys from a secure config and not exposing them). For now, just note that design will keep that in mind (e.g., a config file for API keys that the Broker uses for live mode).

By planning for extensibility from the start, we avoid painting ourselves into a corner. The initial Binance-only, backtest-only system will be designed in a way that scales up to a multi-exchange, live trading platform over time with iterative development.
