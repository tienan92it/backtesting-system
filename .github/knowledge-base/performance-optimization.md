# Performance Optimization

Backtesting can be computationally intensive, especially for long time periods or complex strategies (e.g., ML models). We need to optimize for efficient execution and quick result analysis, so that users can iterate on strategies rapidly. Here are strategies for performance optimization:

**Vectorized Operations**: Take advantage of NumPy and Pandas to minimize Python-level loops. For example:

- If computing technical indicators, use Pandas built-in functions (like `df['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()`) or TA libraries that are implemented in C/NumPy. This computes all values in one go in optimized C code, instead of looping in Python for each time step.
- Some strategies can be fully vectorized. For instance, a moving average crossover could be computed as arrays of signals (1 for buy, -1 for sell) by shifting the moving average arrays and checking where one crosses the other. A library like VectorBT demonstrates how entire strategies can sometimes be vectorized for speed ([Best Backtesting Library for Python – Martin Mayer-Krebs](https://mayerkrebs.com/best-backtesting-library-for-python/#:~:text=The%20fastest%20python%20library%20for,commonly%20unavailable%20on%20these%20backtesters)). Our engine will primarily use an event loop (for flexibility), but we can still vectorize parts (indicator calc, metric calc).
- Numpy operations and array slicing are highly optimized; wherever possible, within the `next()` logic we should use array operations rather than Python math. E.g., if checking a condition over a window, maybe pre-compute that window as a NumPy array and use `.all()` or `.any()`.

**Efficient Data Structures**: Use the right data structures:

- Pandas DataFrames are convenient, but for very large datasets (millions of rows), they can be heavy. In such cases, using NumPy arrays or Python lists of primitives might be lighter. We should test the performance for typical use cases (e.g., 1 year of minute data ~ 525k rows; 5 years might be 2.6 million rows). Pandas can handle this, but memory might be an issue.
- We could allow the engine to operate on NumPy arrays directly for core price series to reduce overhead. For example, have `close_prices` as a NumPy array and iterate index by index rather than using DataFrame row operations, which incur more overhead.

**Just-In-Time Compilation**: Consider using **Numba** to JIT-compile critical loops. Numba can take a Python function that is numeric-heavy and compile it to machine code for speed. For example, a custom loop to simulate trade execution could be numba-optimized if it avoids Python objects. This requires careful design (e.g., use numpy arrays for portfolio values). Numba works best with pure numeric code. We might not need it initially if performance is acceptable, but it’s an option if we identify bottlenecks (e.g., running an ML prediction thousands of times might be fine as is, but if heavy, numba or Cython could help if the model inference can be vectorized).

**Parallel Processing**: If users want to **optimize hyperparameters** or run **multiple backtests** (e.g., different strategy variations or a grid search on moving average lengths), we should enable running these in parallel to utilize multiple CPU cores. Python’s `multiprocessing` or joblib can run separate backtest instances in parallel processes. This doesn’t change single-run speed, but improves overall workflow time for testing many scenarios. We can integrate a simple parallel loop for parameter sweeps, or allow the user to specify multiple strategies to test in one go. (Caveat: Avoid sharing large data memory between processes; instead, each process load its data or use OS-level copy-on-write. For big data, a better approach might be to use libraries that handle parallelism like Dask or Ray, but that might be overkill initially.)

**Memory Management**: Provide options to limit memory usage:

- If data is extremely large, allow backtesting in chunks (though that complicates strategy continuity – so not trivial). Alternatively, require the user to supply manageable data.
- If the strategy stores a lot of state, ensure it’s cleaned up after the run (to avoid memory leaks if running many backtests in a session).

**Profile and Benchmark**: Use Python’s profiling tools (cProfile) on sample strategies to find slow spots. Optimize the hot path – which is likely the inner loop of the backtest. We expect the strategy’s logic and our order simulation to be the main work each iteration. If a user’s strategy is slow (e.g. an extremely complex ML prediction), that’s on the user’s side; but we can provide guidance like “if your strategy is slow, consider reducing complexity or using faster libraries”.

**Leverage Existing Fast Libraries**: Whenever possible, delegate to optimized libraries:

- For performance metrics, we can use the **Empyrical** library which is optimized for large return series (it uses numpy internally).
- For indicators, TA-Lib is in C (fast), Pandas TA is vectorized – both are efficient.
- If plotting results, use libraries that can handle large data (but since CLI, plotting may be minimal).

**Example**: To illustrate performance gains: a naive Python loop checking for crosses might take significantly longer than using a vectorized diff of two series. By replacing loops with vector operations, you can often speed up 10x or more. VectorBT authors note that vectorization gives it a huge speed edge in backtests ([Best Backtesting Library for Python – Martin Mayer-Krebs](https://mayerkrebs.com/best-backtesting-library-for-python/#:~:text=The%20fastest%20python%20library%20for,commonly%20unavailable%20on%20these%20backtesters)). We might not reach C++ speeds, but careful coding can make backtests on reasonably large datasets finish in seconds rather than minutes.

**Scalability Testing**: Test the system on different lengths of data (1 month vs 1 year vs 5 years of minute data) and different strategy complexities. This will inform if we need further optimizations. If extremely high frequency (tick-level) is a goal for some, that may require specialized handling (stream processing, simplified logic, possibly using Python’s asyncio or a C++ backend), but that’s likely outside our scope for individual traders at this stage.

In summary, optimize first by using efficient Python constructs (vectorization, good algorithms), and only if needed move to more complex optimizations (JIT or parallel processing). The aim is that an average backtest (say one year of data with a moderate complexity strategy) should run in a matter of seconds to a minute on a typical PC. Fast feedback encourages users to experiment more.
