# AI-Driven Crypto Backtesting Workflow: Implementation Plan

 ([image]()) *Figure: Overview of the AI-driven backtesting workflow. The system parses a natural-language strategy into code and executes it through a backtesting engine, returning a performance report to the user.*

This plan outlines a step-by-step approach to build a **minimal viable product (MVP)** for an AI-driven crypto backtesting system. The solution is broken into **modular components** – each with a clear responsibility and interface – so they can be developed, tested, and improved independently ([Multi-layer architecture to backtest a trading strategy | Medium](https://eveince.medium.com/the-backtesting-platform-the-architecture-and-its-requirements-6d710dded956#:~:text=This%20given%20multi,layer%20architecture)). We will use a **React** front-end for user interaction, a **FastAPI** backend for orchestration, **OpenAI’s API** for strategy parsing/code generation, and a Python **backtesting engine** (e.g. Backtrader) for executing strategies. The focus is on core functionality (e.g. simple indicators like SMA, EMA, RSI) with a design that allows incremental extension over time.

## Step 1: Backtesting Engine (Runner) Setup

**Responsibilities:** Set up the backtesting component that will execute generated trading strategies on historical crypto data and produce results. This module encapsulates the trading engine logic.

- **Choose a backtesting library** – For simplicity, use an existing Python backtesting engine like **Backtrader** (robust and widely used) or the lightweight `backtesting.py` library. These frameworks let you define a strategy as a Python class with a `next()` method that executes on each time step ([Backtrader for Backtesting (Python) - A Complete Guide - AlgoTrading101 Blog](https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/#:~:text=class%20AverageTrueRange%28bt)). For example, Backtrader strategies subclass `bt.Strategy` and implement trading logic in `next()` ([Backtrader for Backtesting (Python) - A Complete Guide - AlgoTrading101 Blog](https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/#:~:text=class%20AverageTrueRange%28bt)) ([Backtrader for Backtesting (Python) - A Complete Guide - AlgoTrading101 Blog](https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/#:~:text=def%20next,ATR%20%3D%20range_total%20%2F%2014)).  
- **Input/Output:** Define the contract for this module. **Input** will be a strategy definition (code or object) plus any parameters (e.g. historical price data, initial capital, etc.). **Output** will be backtest results – e.g. a list of trades, time series of portfolio value, and summary metrics (ROI, Sharpe ratio, etc.). Use a simple data class or dict to structure these results (for example: `{ "returns": pd.Series, "trades": [...], "metrics": {...} }`).  
- **Minimal Implementation:** Hard-code a simple strategy first to verify the engine (e.g. a buy-and-hold or SMA crossover strategy). Load historical data (perhaps from a CSV or an API) and run a backtest through the engine, ensuring you can retrieve basic performance metrics. For Backtrader, instantiate a `Cerebro` engine, add data (you can use Backtrader’s built-in Yahoo Finance data feed for quick testing), add the strategy, then run `cerebro.run()` to execute. Confirm you can get results like final portfolio value or a trade log.  
- **Integration Tips:** Keep this runner logic in its own module/file (e.g. `runner.py`). Provide a function like `run_backtest(strategy_code: str, data_params: dict) -> BacktestResult`. In the MVP, you might integrate the strategy code by using Python’s `exec()` to dynamically define the strategy class from the generated code, then run it. (Be cautious with execution of dynamic code; for now assume a trusted environment or sanitize the input.) By isolating the backtest runner, you can later swap in a different engine or move this to a microservice without impacting other parts of the system.

## Step 2: Strategy Parser Module

**Responsibilities:** Interpret the user’s plain-English strategy description and convert it into a structured form that can be turned into code. This component ensures the user’s intent is correctly understood.

- **Approach:** Start with a straightforward implementation using an **LLM** to parse the description. Since we plan to use an LLM for code generation, an explicit parser might be minimal. However, for modularity, define this as a separate step that could be replaced by rule-based parsing in the future if needed. For the MVP, the “parser” might simply pass the raw text to the code generator (i.e. we combine parsing and generation in one LLM prompt).  
- **Input/Output:** **Input** is the natural language strategy description (e.g. *“Buy when 50-day EMA crosses above 200-day EMA, sell when price falls 5%”*). **Output** could be a structured representation of the strategy logic – for instance, a Python dictionary or a custom `StrategySpec` object capturing the indicators, conditions, and actions. For the first version, you might skip the structured intermediate form and go straight to code generation; but having a defined format (even if not fully used yet) is good for future modularity. For example, `StrategySpec` might contain fields like `entry_rules: list` and `exit_rules: list`, where each rule is a small dict like `{"indicator": "EMA", "period":50, "condition": "crosses_above", "target_indicator": "EMA", "target_period":200}`.  
- **Minimal Implementation:** If using the LLM directly without an intermediate format, ensure the prompt explicitly asks for code (we’ll handle that in the next module). If you do implement an intermediate parser, you could start by handling a limited number of keywords with simple Python logic (e.g., use regex or parse known indicator names like “SMA” or “RSI”). For example, detect phrases like “\d+-day SMA” or “RSI above X” and fill a `StrategySpec`. This rule-based fallback can be helpful for testing without calling the API.  
- **Tools:** The primary tool here will be the **OpenAI API** (GPT-4 or Codex model) to interpret natural language. OpenAI’s models are capable of understanding intent in text and generating structured outputs ([OpenAI Codex | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/#:~:text=GPT%E2%80%913%E2%80%99s%20main%20skill%20is%20generating,everyone%20to%20do%20more%20with%C2%A0computers)). No additional library is strictly necessary if using the LLM directly, but you might consider a library like **spaCy** or **NLTK** if building a manual parser for specific terms.  
- **Integration Tips:** Encapsulate this in a function or class (e.g. `parse_strategy(description: str) -> StrategySpec`). This function could internally call the LLM or use local parsing. By isolating it, you can later improve parsing (for instance, adding more indicators or handling more complex grammar) without affecting other modules. If the parser returns a structured spec, the next Code Generator module should be designed to accept that spec.

## Step 3: Strategy Code Generator Module

**Responsibilities:** Generate executable Python strategy code based on the parsed strategy description (or the description itself). This is the “AI generation” core that converts intent into actual code for the backtesting engine.

- **Approach:** Leverage an **LLM (Large Language Model)** for code generation. Use OpenAI’s GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5/Codex) via their API to transform the strategy description or spec into Python code that our backtesting engine can run. The LLM will act as the translator from English to code ([OpenAI Codex | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/#:~:text=GPT%E2%80%913%E2%80%99s%20main%20skill%20is%20generating,everyone%20to%20do%20more%20with%C2%A0computers)).  
- **Input/Output:** **Input** is the strategy description (and optionally the structured spec from the parser if available). **Output** is a string of Python code implementing the strategy. For compatibility with Backtrader, have the LLM produce a complete strategy class that the engine can execute. For example, prompt the LLM to output a class inheriting from `bt.Strategy` with an `__init__` (setting up indicators) and `next()` (defining buy/sell logic) ([Backtrader for Backtesting (Python) - A Complete Guide - AlgoTrading101 Blog](https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/#:~:text=class%20AverageTrueRange%28bt)). Ensure the code only uses the limited set of indicators and logic we support in MVP (SMA, EMA, RSI, simple comparisons). You might provide a template or example in the prompt to guide the model (e.g., a sample SMA crossover strategy code as context).  
- **Minimal Implementation:** Focus on a few basic strategy patterns. For instance: 
  - *Indicator Crossover:* e.g. generate code that buys when a short SMA crosses above a long SMA, and sells on the opposite cross. 
  - *Threshold Condition:* e.g. generate code that buys when RSI < 30 (oversold) and sells when RSI > 70.  
  Craft prompt instructions to restrict the model to these patterns initially (“If the strategy mentions moving averages or ‘crossover’, use SMA/EMA crossover logic; if it mentions RSI levels, use an RSI indicator condition.”). Test with a few sample descriptions to ensure the output code is syntactically correct and logically matches the description. It may take some prompt tuning (e.g. asking the model to only use certain library calls).  
- **Tools/Libraries:** Use OpenAI’s Python client (`openai` package) to call the model. No additional code-generation library is needed, though you may consider **LangChain** in the future to manage prompts or to easily switch LLM providers. Keep the prompt engineering simple for the first version (possibly one-shot prompting with an example).  
- **Integration Tips:** Implement this as a separate function (e.g. `generate_code(strategy_spec_or_text) -> str`). This function should be independent of the rest of the system (it could even be in its own micro-service or run locally for development). By decoupling code generation, you have the flexibility to swap in different models (open-source LLMs) later. For instance, you could later check an environment variable to decide if it calls OpenAI or a local model. Also, consider adding basic **validation** of the generated code – e.g., after generation, you might `exec` it in a sandboxed context to ensure it defines the expected Strategy class without syntax errors, and maybe verify the class has certain attributes (like an attribute for the indicator or a next method). For now, handle errors by catching exceptions when running the code in the next step and reporting them (so you can iteratively improve prompts).

## Step 4: Backtest Execution & Result Collection

**Responsibilities:** Combine the generated strategy code with the backtesting engine to execute the strategy on data. This expands the Runner from Step 1 to integrate with the code generation output, producing concrete performance results.

- **Loading the Strategy Code:** After obtaining the strategy code string from the generator, the backend needs to execute this code so that the strategy class becomes available to the engine. For MVP, a simple approach is to use Python’s `exec()` function to run the code within a controlled namespace (e.g., an isolated dictionary or module). This will define the strategy class (say named `GeneratedStrategy`). Make sure to document this clearly and consider security implications (for now, assume trusted input or limit what the code can do by convention).  
- **Running the Backtest:** Use the Runner module (Step 1) to execute the now-loaded strategy. For example, if using Backtrader: instantiate `cerebro = bt.Cerebro()`, add data feed (perhaps historical data for a user-specified crypto ticker or a default like BTC-USD), add the generated strategy class (`cerebro.addstrategy(GeneratedStrategy)`), set initial cash (`cerebro.broker.setcash(…)`), and then call `cerebro.run()` ([Backtrader for Backtesting (Python) - A Complete Guide - AlgoTrading101 Blog](https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/#:~:text=To%20plot%20a%20chart%20in,cerebro.run)). Ensure this runs headless (no GUI plotting) since we are in a backend environment – we just want the data. Collect key results: you can attach analyzers in Backtrader (e.g., Sharpe ratio, drawdown) or manually compute results from the strategy’s trade logs. At minimum, record the daily portfolio value (equity curve) or at least final returns.  
- **Input/Output:** **Input** is the strategy code (from Step 3) and any backtest parameters (such as data range, asset, initial capital – which could be defaulted if not provided by user). **Output** is a *BacktestResult* data structure containing the performance metrics and raw data needed for the report. For MVP, include: total return (%), perhaps CAGR, max drawdown, and maybe Sharpe ratio (if easily computed). Also include the time series of portfolio value over time for plotting, or at least the data to reconstruct it. This can be a Pandas Series indexed by date or a list of equity values.  
- **Integration Tips:** This step ties together the code generation and execution – it can be part of the Runner module or a small orchestrator function (e.g. `execute_strategy_code(code:str, data_params) -> BacktestResult`). Keep the actual backtest invocation logic separate from the FastAPI request handler (so it’s easier to test in isolation). You might want to log or save the generated code for debugging. Also, if the backtest is time-consuming on large data, consider making this an **async/background task** in FastAPI so the API can respond quickly and possibly poll for results. For now, with a single asset and short timeframe, it should be fast enough to run inline, but structure your code so that switching to a background worker (or Celery job) is straightforward if needed.

## Step 5: Report Builder Module

**Responsibilities:** Turn the raw backtest results into an HTML report containing key metrics and visualizations, which will be presented to the user. The report builder focuses on formatting and presentation of results, separate from the computation.

- **Approach:** For the MVP, generate a simple yet informative report. This could be as basic as a pre-formatted HTML string or template that displays metrics and an image plot. Ensure this module can be easily extended (for example, to add more charts or tables of trade stats later).  
- **Input/Output:** **Input** is the BacktestResult from Step 4 (performance metrics + time series data). **Output** is HTML content (which could be a complete HTML document or a snippet to embed in a page). We want metrics like total return, maybe # of trades, etc., and at least one visualization (e.g., equity curve over time or price chart with buy/sell points).  
- **Minimal Implementation:** Start with summary text and a simple chart. For example, calculate total return = (final equity / initial equity - 1) * 100%, and perhaps max drawdown and Sharpe. Embed these in an HTML template. Use a plotting library to create a chart: e.g., **Matplotlib** or **Plotly** to plot the equity curve. Matplotlib can save an image (PNG) of the equity curve which you then base64-encode and embed in the HTML `<img>` tag. Alternatively, use Plotly to generate an interactive chart and include its HTML/JS. For simplicity, a static image is fine at first. If using Backtrader, you could also utilize its built-in plotting, but it may produce a complex chart by default; a custom Matplotlib plot of the equity is easier to control.  
- **Tools:** Consider using **Jinja2 templates** with FastAPI (FastAPI supports Jinja2 for HTML responses) to create an HTML report from a context (metrics and paths to charts). Another powerful option is the **QuantStats** library, which can generate a complete tear-sheet HTML given a returns series ([Backtrader for Backtesting (Python) - A Complete Guide - AlgoTrading101 Blog](https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/#:~:text=Another%20good%20option%20is%20to,a%20notebook%20that%20PyFolio%20requires)) ([Backtrader for Backtesting (Python) - A Complete Guide - AlgoTrading101 Blog](https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/#:~:text=quantstats)). For example, `quantstats.reports.html(returns, output='stats.html')` will create an HTML file with performance statistics and graphs, which could be served to the user ([Backtrader for Backtesting (Python) - A Complete Guide - AlgoTrading101 Blog](https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20jump%20back%20to%20the,to%20create%20a%20stats%20tearsheet)). QuantStats may be overkill for the first iteration, but keep it in mind as you can integrate it later to enrich the report.  
- **Integration Tips:** Keep report generation separated from the backtest logic. For instance, have a function `build_report(backtest_result) -> str` that returns an HTML string. This function can live in its own module (e.g. `report.py`) and use templates located in a `/templates` directory if using Jinja2. Ensure the content is sanitized or safe for display, especially if you ever include portions of user input (for now, our content comes from our system). By isolating reporting, you can upgrade the visuals independently (for example, swapping in a JS chart library or adding new metrics) without changing how strategies are parsed or executed.

## Step 6: Backend API (FastAPI) Integration

**Responsibilities:** Orchestrate the end-to-end workflow by exposing an API endpoint that ties together the parser, code generator, runner, and report builder. The FastAPI backend handles HTTP requests from the React front-end, coordinates all modules, and returns the final result.

- **Setup:** Create a FastAPI app with a clear structure (you might use the typical project layout with separate modules and routers). Define a POST endpoint (for example, `/backtest`) that accepts the user’s strategy description and any optional parameters (like ticker, date range – or use defaults in MVP).  
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Inside the endpoint:
  1. Receive the request JSON (e.g. `{ "strategy": "…", "symbol": "BTC-USD", "start": "2020-01-01", "end": "2021-01-01" }`). 
  2. Call the **Strategy Parser** module to interpret the strategy (e.g. `spec = parse_strategy(description)`).
  3. Pass the result to the **Code Generator** to get Python code (`code = generate_code(spec or description)`).
  4. Execute the code with the **Backtest Runner** (`result = run_backtest(code, data_params)`).
  5. Build the **HTML Report** from results (`report_html = build_report(result)`). 
  6. Return the report HTML as the response (possibly as `{ "report": "<html>...</html>" }` JSON, or directly as HTML with appropriate headers).  
- **Integration Details:** Ensure each call is wrapped in error handling. If parsing or code generation fails (e.g., LLM returns invalid code), catch the exception and return a meaningful error message to the user. Similarly, handle backtest errors (like if data for the symbol is not found). Logging is useful here – log the input and outputs of each module for debugging.  
- **Asynchronous vs Synchronous:** For MVP, you can keep this flow synchronous (FastAPI will run it in the request thread). If backtests are slow, you might implement the endpoint to immediately respond (202 Accepted) and run the backtest in a background task ([Background Tasks - FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/background-tasks/#:~:text=You%20can%20define%20background%20tasks,run%20after%20returning%20a%20response)) ([Background Tasks - FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/background-tasks/#:~:text=Python%203)), but that adds complexity (needing a polling or notification mechanism). Initially, assume the backtest can complete in a reasonable time (<few seconds for a year of data, for example).  
- **Modularity:** Each module (parser, generator, runner, report) should be injected or imported as needed. To allow easy replacement, you could define an interface for each – e.g., a base class or just rely on function signatures – so that, for instance, switching the code generator to a different LLM only requires changing that function implementation. Document these interfaces (e.g., `parse_strategy: str -> StrategySpec`, etc.). This ensures future developers (or yourself) can upgrade components in isolation.  
- **Security & Config:** Store API keys (like OpenAI key) securely, using environment variables or a secrets manager, and load them in the FastAPI app startup. Also, if deploying publicly, consider authentication for this API to prevent abuse (since it could incur cost on the OpenAI API). For now, an MVP deployed for internal or limited use might skip auth, but plan for it.

## Step 7: Web UI (React Frontend)

**Responsibilities:** Provide an intuitive interface for users to input strategy descriptions and view the backtesting results. The React app will communicate with the FastAPI backend and display the HTML report.

- **UI Components:** Create a simple page with a form for strategy input. This could be a textarea or input field where the user types a strategy in plain English. Optionally, allow additional inputs like symbol, date range, etc., but you can start with just the strategy description for minimal scope (and use default values for other params). Include a submit button to run the backtest.  
- **Displaying Results:** On form submission, call the backend API (using **fetch** or Axios) to send the strategy description. Show a loading indicator while waiting for the response. Once the HTML report is returned, display it. Since the report is HTML, one approach is to inject it into a div using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (if you trust the content). Make sure to sanitize or only do this if the backend is under your control (to avoid XSS issues). Alternatively, the backend could return JSON with structured data and the front-end could use React components or chart libraries to render the report. For MVP, using the pre-generated HTML is fastest. You might also consider opening the report in a new window or embedding it in an iframe, but inline display in the React app is more seamless.  
- **Integration Tips:** Use a state management (React hooks or context) to store the report HTML. E.g., `const [reportHtml, setReportHtml] = useState(null)`. After fetching the data from the API, set this state with the returned HTML string. Then in the JSX, conditionally render a `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: reportHtml }} />` when reportHtml is not null. If using this approach, ensure the backend’s HTML is well-formed and self-contained (include styles inline or in a `<style>` tag, because external CSS might not apply inside the injected HTML). For a cleaner approach, you could parse the JSON result and use a chart library like **recharts** or **Plotly React** to plot the equity curve, and simple JSX to show metrics. This would avoid raw HTML injection and give you more control over styling (but requires more frontend work).  
- **Development Order:** Build a very basic UI first – even without full styling – to test the end-to-end flow. Once the backend is running (Steps 1-6), manually try a few strategies via a tool like cURL or Postman to ensure the API works. Then implement the React call to that API. This way you isolate frontend issues from backend. Keep CORS in mind: configure FastAPI to allow the React app’s origin (you can use `fastapi-cors` or set the headers manually) so the browser can call the API.  
- **Incremental Improvement:** After MVP is working, you can enhance the UI with preset examples, form validations (e.g., require input text), and better formatting of the output (maybe a nicer template or interactive charts). But initially, focus on the core functionality: send text -> get report.

## Step 8: Deployment Considerations

**Responsibilities:** Deploy both the frontend and backend to a cloud environment so end-users can access the system. Ensure the system is configured for production (keys, environment, scalability basics).

- **Frontend Deployment:** Since it’s a React app, you can deploy it easily on static hosting or platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**. Vercel is a good choice (especially if you use Next.js, but even with plain React it can host it). Simply build the React app (`npm run build`) and let the platform serve the static files. Ensure the API URL is correctly set (maybe use an environment variable or config file in the React build to point to the backend’s URL).  
- **Backend Deployment:** Options include AWS or GCP services, or even Vercel serverless functions. For a FastAPI app, consider packaging it in a **Docker container** for portability. You could use **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** or **AWS Fargate (ECS)**, or **GCP Cloud Run** to run the container. These manage the infrastructure and let you scale easily. If you prefer serverless, you could try deploying FastAPI on AWS Lambda using API Gateway (with a tool like Mangum to adapt FastAPI to Lambda), but that can be more complex for an MVP. Another straightforward approach: use **Railway.app** or **Heroku** (if it still offers free tiers) to host the FastAPI app.  
- **Environment Configuration:** In production, set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable on the backend. Also configure any other secrets (perhaps a database URL if you later store results, etc.). Use HTTPS for API calls (which is default if using cloud services). If using Docker, write a simple Dockerfile (start from `tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi:python3.9` for convenience, or your own base) and ensure CORS is allowed from your frontend domain.  
- **Testing in Prod:** Once deployed, test the workflow through the React UI on the production URL. Use a sample strategy to see that everything works end-to-end. Monitor the logs of the FastAPI service (most platforms provide logging) to catch any runtime errors (for example, memory issues or exceptions from the LLM or backtester). Since this is an MVP, expect to iterate – you might find that the LLM needs different prompt tuning in a production setting or that the backtester needs more data handling. Having each component separated will make these updates easier, as you can deploy changes to one part without rewriting the entire system.  
- **Future Extensibility:** With the modular design, you can now enhance each part independently. For example, to add more indicators or complex strategy logic, you can improve the parser/generator prompts or even swap to a more powerful model. To speed up backtests, you could move the runner to a more powerful machine or optimize data handling. If wanting to use an open-source LLM later (to reduce API costs), you can host that model (perhaps on an EC2 or GCP VM with GPUs) and just adjust the code generator module to call it instead of OpenAI – the rest of the system remains the same. This deployable MVP serves as a solid foundation that can be incrementally extended while maintaining clear separations of concern between components.
