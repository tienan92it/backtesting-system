# AI-Driven Crypto Backtesting Workflow

Implementing an AI-driven backtesting pipeline involves seamless transitions from a user’s natural language strategy description to executable code and results. Below we outline each stage of the workflow with recommended approaches, tools, and best practices, ensuring easy web UI integration and support for iterative refinement of strategies.

## 1. User Strategy Description (Natural Language)

Users can describe a strategy in plain English (e.g. “Buy when RSI < 30 and sell when RSI > 70”). The system must interpret this and convert it into a structured strategy specification. Two main approaches are considered:

- **LLM-Based Parsing:** Leverage large language models (LLMs) or NLP frameworks to parse the description and extract conditions, indicators, and parameters. For example, an LLM like GPT-4 or OpenAI Codex can be prompted to interpret the text and output a structured form (JSON or pseudocode) representing entry/exit rules. Prompt engineering is key – providing examples of strategy descriptions and their structured interpretations helps the model understand the format ([Adaptrade Software: Is ChatGPT a Viable Trading Strategy Editor?](http://www.adaptrade.com/Newsletter/NL-LLMasEditor.htm#:~:text=To%20generate%20trading%20strategy%20code,the%20LLM%20would%20contain%20more)). In practice, one can include a template or code snippet of a strategy in the prompt, so the model’s output adheres to the backtester’s API format ([I built a backtester that converts natural language to trading strategies, looking for feature requests and feedback - still in Alpha so completely free, implementing live trading with IBKR soon : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h0m6x1/i_built_a_backtester_that_converts_natural/#:~:text=Yes%20I%20use%20it%20to,code%20or%20simple%20language%20with)). This few-shot technique guides the AI to produce the correct structure and indicator names.

- **Rule-Based NLP:** Alternatively, define a simple domain-specific language or use regex and NLP libraries to identify strategy components. For instance, you might use **spaCy** or **NLTK** to recognize indicator names (like “RSI”) and numerical thresholds, or build a grammar with **Lark**/ANTLR for expressions like “<” or “>”. This can translate the sentence into an intermediate representation (e.g. a Python dict or custom AST of the strategy logic). While this approach can work for well-defined patterns, an LLM is often more flexible for varied user input.

**Frameworks & Tools:** If using LLMs, consider libraries like **LangChain** to manage prompts and parsing of LLM outputs (it can help ensure the model returns JSON, for example). Ensure the prompt clearly instructs the model to output only structured data or code. Best practices include confirming the parsed output covers all parts of the description and detecting if any required element (indicator, threshold, etc.) is missing. If information is missing or ambiguous, the system should ask clarifying questions before proceeding (e.g. “Which asset or timeframe should we use?”). This can be done via the UI or another LLM prompt.

## 2. Code Generation (Compatible with Backtester)

In this stage, the structured strategy spec is turned into executable Python code that plugs into the existing backtesting engine’s API (e.g., generating a Strategy class with `on_bar`/`next` methods or a function with entry/exit logic). The goals are to produce correct, efficient code and to do so safely.

- **Template-Based Generation:** If the backtester requires boilerplate code (for example, a class inheriting from a base Strategy), use templates to fill in the parsed logic. **Jinja2** is a good choice for code templating – you can create a template with placeholders for indicators, conditions, and parameters, and then render it with the specifics. This guarantees the output code conforms to the API. For instance, you might have a template like: 

  ```jinja
  class GeneratedStrategy(BaseStrategy):
      def init(self):
          {{ indicator_defs }}
      def next(self):
          if {{ buy_condition }}:
              self.buy()
          elif {{ sell_condition }}:
              self.sell()
  ```
  The system can populate `indicator_defs`, `buy_condition`, etc., based on the user’s rules.

- **LLM-Based Code Synthesis:** LLMs (like OpenAI Codex, GPT-4, or Code Llama) can generate code from the strategy description or intermediate spec. Here, **prompt engineering** again is crucial. One robust method is to include an example strategy code in the prompt and ask the model to modify or create a new one according to the user’s rules ([Adaptrade Software: Is ChatGPT a Viable Trading Strategy Editor?](http://www.adaptrade.com/Newsletter/NL-LLMasEditor.htm#:~:text=To%20generate%20trading%20strategy%20code,the%20LLM%20would%20contain%20more)). This was demonstrated by developers who provided a code “framework” in the prompt so the AI would output code consistent with the backtester’s requirements ([I built a backtester that converts natural language to trading strategies, looking for feature requests and feedback - still in Alpha so completely free, implementing live trading with IBKR soon : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h0m6x1/i_built_a_backtester_that_converts_natural/#:~:text=Yes%20I%20use%20it%20to,code%20or%20simple%20language%20with)). The model essentially fills in the logic while keeping the structure intact, resulting in code that usually needs little manual correction. Another method is to let the LLM directly generate code from scratch, but having it follow a template or specific class structure improves accuracy and reduces errors.

- **Safety and Validation:** Running generated code introduces security concerns, especially if using an LLM where the output isn’t guaranteed safe. **Sandboxing** the execution is recommended. For CPython, you can use libraries like **RestrictedPython** to limit what the strategy code can do (disallowing dangerous operations), or use PyPy’s sandbox mode to intercept I/O calls ([sandbox - How can I safely run untrusted python code? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33252226/how-can-i-safely-run-untrusted-python-code#:~:text=For%20CPython%2C%20use%20RestrictedPython%20to,a%20restricted%20subset%20of%20Python)). At the OS level, running the backtest in a container or VM for each user strategy adds another layer of isolation ([sandbox - How can I safely run untrusted python code? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33252226/how-can-i-safely-run-untrusted-python-code#:~:text=,as%20KVM%20or%20VirtualBox)). This ensures that even if the generated code is malicious or buggy (e.g., an infinite loop or an attempt to access the filesystem), it won’t harm the host system. It’s also good practice to review the generated code or run static analysis: for example, parse the code to an AST and check for disallowed imports or system calls before execution. 

- **Tools:** Apart from Jinja2 and LLM APIs, consider using **AST** modules or even simple regex checks to validate the code (e.g., ensure it only uses whitelisted libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, or the backtester’s API). If using an LLM in production, maintain prompt templates and test them with a variety of inputs to see that the output code is reliable. You might also integrate small unit tests (if applicable) that run on the generated strategy with sample data to catch obvious logic errors before full backtesting.

## 3. Backtest Execution

Once the strategy code is ready, the system runs the backtest on historical data. This step should be automated, with sensible defaults and robust error handling, since end-users may not provide all necessary details.

- **Configuration:** Use user-specified settings or default values for things like the asset symbol, date range, timeframe, and initial capital. For example, if the user doesn’t specify, the system might default to Bitcoin (BTC) on daily data for the past one year, with a starting capital of \$10,000. It’s important to detect missing parameters either from the natural language input or via a pre-run check. If a required parameter isn’t provided, pause to ask the user (through the UI) or supply a reasonable default and inform them. This can be handled in the UI form (e.g., separate fields for symbol and dates) or through the LLM by analyzing the description (if the user said “on ETH”, you can capture that).

- **Running the Engine:** Invoke the backtesting engine’s API programmatically. Many Python backtest frameworks (like **Backtrader**, **zipline**, **backtesting.py**, etc.) allow you to load data and run a strategy with a few calls. For instance, with Backtrader one would create a `Cerebro`, add the strategy class, set cash and data feeds, then call `run()`. This should be done asynchronously or in a worker thread/process to keep the web interface responsive. In a web UI scenario, you might trigger a background job (using something like Celery or AsyncIO) to run the backtest and then periodically check for completion or results.

- **Error Logging and Handling:** It’s crucial to catch and log exceptions during the run. Common errors might include divide-by-zero in strategy logic, missing data, or misused indicators. If the strategy code raises an error, the system should capture the stack trace or message and present a user-friendly error report. For example, “Error: Indicator RSI not found – did you mean to add an RSI indicator?” This ties into iterative refinement: the user might need to adjust their strategy description if it was interpreted incorrectly or if some condition is impossible to execute. Logging can be done to a file or in-memory, but key is to surface it on the UI.

- **Validating Results:** After a run, verify that results make sense. Check that the strategy took some trades (if it took zero trades, maybe the conditions never met – the UI could warn “The strategy didn’t execute any trades; you may want to adjust your conditions”). Basic performance metrics should be computed to ensure the output isn’t empty. It’s also wise to ensure resource limits – if the backtest runs too long or uses too much memory (perhaps the user chose a 10-year high-frequency backtest), the system should stop it and inform the user to refine the parameters. Using **timeouts** or limiting data size can prevent runaway processes.

- **Best Practices:** As noted in a ChatGPT trading bot guide, always backtest on historical data to validate performance before trusting a strategy live ([How to build a ChatGPT-powered AI trading bot: A step-by-step guide](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-build-a-chatgpt-powered-ai-trading-bot-a-step-by-step-guide#:~:text=A%20strategy%20might%20seem%20profitable,historical%20price%20data%20for%20testing)) ([How to build a ChatGPT-powered AI trading bot: A step-by-step guide](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-build-a-chatgpt-powered-ai-trading-bot-a-step-by-step-guide#:~:text=,bull%2C%20bear%20and%20sideways%20markets)). One should simulate trades and then analyze results like profit/loss, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, etc., which we do in the next stage. It’s also helpful to allow **parameter tuning** – e.g., if the strategy has adjustable parameters (periods of indicators, thresholds), the system could let the user re-run quickly with different values or even offer an optimization tool. However, parameter optimization should be approached carefully to avoid overfitting.

## 4. Results Output as HTML Report

After execution, the system generates a comprehensive report of the backtest performance. The report should be in HTML (for easy display in a web interface, or downloading), and include key metrics, visualizations, and possibly raw data like trade logs.

**Key contents to include:**

- **Summary Metrics:** Provide statistics that summarize performance. Common metrics are **total return**, **Sharpe ratio**, **Sortino ratio**, **max drawdown**, **win rate**, **profit factor**, etc. These give a quick sense of risk and reward. For example, the Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return) and max drawdown (worst peak-to-trough loss) are standard evaluation criteria ([best metrics for strategy? : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1gvldue/best_metrics_for_strategy/#:~:text=No_Revolution2700)) ([best metrics for strategy? : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1gvldue/best_metrics_for_strategy/#:~:text=Pitiful)). You can calculate these using libraries (many backtest frameworks have this built-in, or you can use a library like **pandas** or **QuantStats** to compute them). A table at the top of the report can list these metrics.

- **Trade Log:** Include a table of trades executed – each trade’s entry date, entry price, exit date, exit price, profit/loss, and perhaps cumulative equity after the trade. This allows the user to verify the strategy behaved as expected (e.g., check that buys happened when conditions were met). If there were many trades, consider pagination or summary (maybe just show first 10 and last 10 trades, etc., with an option to download full log as CSV).

- **Equity Curve and Charts:** Visualize the performance over time. The equity curve is a fundamental chart – it plots the account value over time, showing growth and drawdowns. A steadily upward curve indicates profits, while sharp dips show drawdowns. Other useful charts include a **drawdown chart** (waterfall of equity drops), a **monthly returns heatmap**, or distribution of returns per trade. Libraries like **Plotly** or **Matplotlib** can generate these charts. Plotly is ideal for interactive visuals – you can embed an interactive equity curve that allows zooming and hovering over points. Plotly (built on D3.js) charts can be saved as HTML snippets and included directly in the report ([

](https://plotly.com/python/v3/html-reports/#:~:text=d3,or%20host%20on%20a%20website)). For example, you might use Plotly to create a candlestick chart marking buy/sell points or an interactive line chart of cumulative returns. If interactivity isn’t needed, a Matplotlib chart (saved as PNG and shown in an `<img>` tag) also works.

 ([image]()) *Figure: Example equity curve with buy (green ▲) and sell (red ▼) signals. Visualizing trade signals on the equity curve helps in understanding strategy behavior.* 

- **Reporting Tools:** To assemble the report, you can use **Jinja2** to create an HTML template where you inject the metrics, tables, and base64-encoded images or Plotly divs. This gives full control over layout (you can style it with CSS to look nice in the web UI). An alternative is to leverage reporting libraries: for instance, **QuantStats** can produce an HTML tear-sheet automatically from returns data ([GitHub - ranaroussi/quantstats: Portfolio analytics for quants, written in Python](https://github.com/ranaroussi/quantstats#:~:text=QuantStats%20is%20comprised%20of%203,main%20modules)). QuantStats generates a detailed report with performance stats and charts in one go (Sharpe, drawdowns, monthly returns, etc. are included) ([best metrics for strategy? : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1gvldue/best_metrics_for_strategy/#:~:text=Pitiful)). You could run `qs.reports.html()` on the strategy’s returns to get an HTML file to embed, though integrating that into a custom UI might require some tweaks. If a more dynamic dashboard is desired, frameworks like **Dash (Plotly Dash)** or **Panel (HoloViz Panel)** can be used. Dash allows you to create a web app with Python where graphs and tables are interactive and can even be updated if the user wants to run a new backtest without reloading the page. Panel is another option to build interactive panels in Python, useful if you envision the backtest results as a live dashboard (it can embed Plotly, Bokeh, or Matplotlib objects and add widgets for filtering). For a web UI that already uses a front-end framework, sending a ready-made HTML report (or the components to build one) might be simplest.

- **Presentation:** Ensure the HTML report is structured clearly: use headings for sections (Overview, Trades, Charts, etc.), include explanatory text for metrics (so a user understands Sharpe or drawdown), and make it visually appealing (green/red for gains/losses, etc.). The report can either be displayed directly in the user’s browser (after the backtest, the UI could show a tab with the HTML content) or provided as a downloadable file. Since the user may refine the strategy and run multiple backtests, you could also implement versioning – e.g., keep each run’s report available until the user decides to discard them, to compare iterations.

## Integration into Web UI and Iterative Refinement

**Web UI Integration:** Each component of this workflow should be exposed in a way that the front-end can interact with. Typically, you’d have endpoints or functions for: submitting a strategy description, running the backtest, and retrieving the report. A possible architecture is a backend service that orchestrates these steps – the UI sends the strategy description to an API endpoint, which triggers the NLP/LLM parsing and code generation. The generated code is then executed (perhaps in a job queue) and once completed, the results are stored (in a database or temporary storage). The UI can poll for completion or be notified via WebSocket. When ready, the report is displayed to the user. This modular design (interpret -> code -> run -> report) fits well into a microservice or layered architecture. For instance, you might have a dedicated **“Strategy Parser”** service (using the LLM or NLP logic), a **“Backtest Runner”** service (which safely executes the code on data), and a **“Report Generator”** module. In a simpler setup, a single server can do all steps sequentially per request, but concurrency and security need to be managed as noted.

**Iterative Refinement:** A major advantage of this AI-driven approach is that users can iteratively improve their strategy in a conversational or repeated manner. After seeing the backtest results, a user might say, “Actually, use an EMA instead of an SMA for the signal,” or “What if we only take long trades?”. The system should accommodate this easily by going back to the parsing and code generation stages with the new instruction. If using a chat-like interface (LLM), the conversation history can be used – the model can take into account the previous strategy and apply the modification the user requested. For example, the OctoBot AI strategy tool allows users to just describe changes, and the AI will modify the existing strategy code accordingly ([How to create your TradingView strategy with AI - OctoBot](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/blog/how-to-create-your-tradingview-strategy-with-ai#:~:text=Once%20you%20created%20your%20strategy%2C,language%20and%20your%20own%20words)) ([How to create your TradingView strategy with AI - OctoBot](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/blog/how-to-create-your-tradingview-strategy-with-ai#:~:text=The%20strategy%20generator%20will%20just,your%20strategy%20code%20for%20you)). This is achieved by prompting the LLM with the original code or strategy spec plus the user’s new request, instructing it to output the revised code. Another approach is simply to let the user edit the natural language description or fill in a new form and rerun the whole pipeline – since it’s relatively fast, this is also feasible.

To support iteration, design the UI to make it convenient. Perhaps show the original description pre-filled so the user can tweak it, or have an “edit strategy” button that highlights parts of the strategy that can be changed (indicators, thresholds, etc.). Each iteration can produce a new report, and it’s useful to allow comparing them (maybe by listing key metrics side by side).

**Architecture Considerations:** Make sure to maintain state appropriately. If using a stateless API, the client (browser) might need to send the full modified description each time. If using a session with an LLM (via something like ChatGPT API with system/user messages), you can keep context so the model remembers the previous strategy – but caution that token context limits could be reached after many edits. A pragmatic solution is to always regenerate code from scratch based on the latest user input (which may be the entire refined description, not just the diff). This ensures consistency.

Logging and versioning each strategy and result is helpful for audit and user reference. You can save the combination of user description, generated code, and performance metrics in a database. This not only helps the user track changes but also provides data to improve the AI parsing/generation over time (learning from cases where it made errors).

Finally, ensure the system is **scalable and robust**: multiple users might be doing this simultaneously on the web UI. Using containerized execution for backtests can allow running them in parallel safely. The LLM calls could become a bottleneck or cost factor, so you might implement caching – if two users ask for the same strategy description, you could reuse a cached result. Integration with a cloud-based LLM service will require handling rate limits, etc., whereas a local model might require sufficient CPU/GPU resources.

By following these practices – from natural language parsing to safe code generation, thorough backtesting, and rich reporting – the workflow becomes a streamlined loop. Users of the web UI can go from an idea expressed in plain language to seeing a detailed performance report within minutes. Each iteration refines the strategy, guided by both the user’s insight and the AI’s ability to translate instructions into tested code, ultimately accelerating the strategy development process in a secure and user-friendly manner. 

**Sources:** The approach is informed by real-world implementations where AI translates descriptions to trading code (e.g., OctoBot’s strategy generator uses a ChatGPT-like model to produce Pine Script from English ([How to create your TradingView strategy with AI - OctoBot](https://www.octobot.cloud/en/blog/how-to-create-your-tradingview-strategy-with-ai#:~:text=This%20artificial%20intelligence%20is%20similar,strategies%20with%20the%20following%20criteria))), by literature on using ChatGPT for trading strategy generation ([Adaptrade Software: Is ChatGPT a Viable Trading Strategy Editor?](http://www.adaptrade.com/Newsletter/NL-LLMasEditor.htm#:~:text=To%20generate%20trading%20strategy%20code,the%20LLM%20would%20contain%20more)), and by best practices in backtesting and performance analysis ([How to build a ChatGPT-powered AI trading bot: A step-by-step guide](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-build-a-chatgpt-powered-ai-trading-bot-a-step-by-step-guide#:~:text=,bull%2C%20bear%20and%20sideways%20markets)) ([best metrics for strategy? : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1gvldue/best_metrics_for_strategy/#:~:text=Pitiful)). This ensures the solution is grounded in proven techniques for building an AI-driven trading system.
